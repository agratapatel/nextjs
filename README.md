Hey, this is the portfolio of Agrata Patel.

I'm a software engineer and a product manager. I'm currently the VP of Product at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com), where I lead the product for the Home and Experiences org.

Before Airbnb, I was a product manager at Meta (previously Facebook), where I led product for the Instagram Feed.
